/*Dashboard Overview*/
This dashboard is built using a dataset related to bike buyers, which was sourced from GitHub. The data was initially transferred to a working sheet, where it underwent a series of cleaning and preparation steps to ensure its quality for analysis. This involved:

Data Cleaning:

Removing Unnecessary Data: Any columns or rows not relevant to the analysis were removed.
Handling Duplicates: 26 rows containing duplicate data were identified and removed to maintain dataset accuracy and reliability.
Data Transformation:

Raw data was structured into a more analytical-friendly format.
Pivot tables were used to extract valuable insights and summarize the data efficiently.

Bike Performance Analysis: It highlights which bike models cover the maximum distance and which models are the most fuel-efficient.
Gender Insights: Males were observed to have a higher likelihood of purchasing bikes than females.
Visualizations:
The dashboard uses a variety of visualizations, including:
Bar charts for age group distribution.
Line graphs for bike performance over time.
Pie charts for gender distribution.
Customized visualizations to explore different segmentations, such as replacing age brackets with exact ages.
